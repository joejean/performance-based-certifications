# performance-based-certifications
A List of Performance-based Technical Certifications. In performance-based tests one needs to demonstrate the ability to use or apply knowledge rather than merely knowing the information. As an engineer, I personally prefer performance-based certifications over the ones that just ask multiple-choice questions :)
